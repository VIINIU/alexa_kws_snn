REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 uut_snn_core/U_SNN_L1/rom_W/dout_reg has an input control pin uut_snn_core/U_SNN_L1/rom_W/dout_reg/ADDRARDADDR[13] (net: uut_snn_core/U_SNN_L1/rom_W/ADDRARDADDR[10]) which is driven by a register (uut_snn_core/U_SNN_L1/u_mac/FSM_sequential_state_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 uut_snn_core/U_SNN_L1/rom_B/dout_reg has an input control pin uut_snn_core/U_SNN_L1/rom_B/dout_reg/ADDRARDADDR[6] (net: uut_snn_core/U_SNN_L1/rom_B/ADDRARDADDR[2]) which is driven by a register (uut_snn_core/U_SNN_L1/u_mac/neuron_idx_reg_reg[2]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
